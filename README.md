# Deploy an Article CMS to Azure 

<i>Cloud Developer using Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program</i>

<p>A simple Content Management System (CMS) for articles, where a user can log in, view published articles, and publish new articles. </p>
 
## My Udacity Project (Azure Applications) Overview

In this project, I was given a simple Content Management System (CMS) for articles, where a user can log in, view published articles, and publish new articles. An article consists of a title, author, and body of text (to be stored in an Azure SQL Server) along with an image (to be stored in Azure Blob Storage).

The CMS includes the following components:

* A web app using Python with the Flask framework.
* A SQL database that contains a user table and an article table for the web app to query.
* A Blob Storage container where images are stored.

I had to create and manage the resources necessary to fully deploy both the necessary storage and compute resources for the app to Azure. As part of the project, I also needed to analyze which resource best fits for app deployment between a VM or App Service. Lastly, I added an authentication option to Sign in with Microsoft, as well as logging for successful and unsuccessful logins.

App examples for the project were given in the starter code and are available [here](https://github.com/kathleenwest/article-cms-azure-demo-project/tree/main/example_images).

## Specifications Completed

I passed and my project met all specifications that are documented in files and screen captures [here](https://github.com/kathleenwest/article-cms-azure-demo-project/tree/main/demo). Also reference the demo video above for a walk through of how my project was setrup in Azure and met the project specifications.

## Project Instructions

First, take a look at the project [rubric](https://github.com/kathleenwest/article-cms-azure-demo-project/blob/main/demo/Rubric.jpg), which will be used to grade your submission. Then, get the starter code from this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd081-c1-provisioning-microsoft-azure-vms-project-starter).

You are expected to do the following to complete this project:

1. Create a Resource Group in Azure.
2. Create an SQL Database in Azure that contains a user table, an article table, and data in each table (populated with the scripts provided in the SQL Scripts folder). Provide a screenshot of the populated tables as detailed further below.
3. Create a Storage Container in Azure for images to be stored in a container. Provide a screenshot of the storage endpoint URL as detailed further below.
4. Add functionality to the Sign In With Microsoft button. This will require completing TODOs in views.py with the msal library, along with appropriate registration in Azure Active Directory.
5. Choose to use either a VM or App Service to deploy the FlaskWebProject to Azure. Complete the analysis template in WRITEUP.md (or include in the README) to compare the two options, as well as detail your reasoning behind choosing one or the other. Once you have made your choice, go through with deployment.
6. Add logging for whether users successfully or unsuccessfully logged in. This will require completing TODOs in __init__.py, as well as adding logging where desired in views.py.
7. To prove that the application in on Azure and working, go to the URL of your deployed app, log in using the credentials in this README, click the Create button, and create an article with the following data: (Title: "Hello World!", Author: "Jane Doe", Body: "My name is Jane Doe and this is my first article!") Upload an image of your choice. Must be either a .png or .jpg. After saving, click back on the article you created and provide a screenshot proving that it was created successfully. Please also make sure the URL is present in the screenshot.
8. Log into the Azure Portal, go to your Resource Group, and provide a screenshot including all of the resources that were created to complete this project. (see sample screenshot in "example_images" folder)
9. Take a screenshot of the Redirect URIs entered for your registered app, related to the MS Login button.
10. Take a screenshot of your logs (can be from the Log stream in Azure) showing logging from an attempt to sign in with an invalid login, as well as a valid login.

## Project Submission

Your submission must include the following, as according to the project rubric:

1. A screenshot of an article created in the Article CMS on Azure. The screenshot must also include the URL. The article should have the following fields set:
Title: "Hello World!", Author: "Jane Doe". Body: "My name is Jane Doe and this is my first article!" An image of your choice. It must be either a .png or .jpg.
2. A screenshot of the resource group from the Azure Portal including all of the resources that were created to complete this project. (see sample screenshot above).
3. A screenshot showing the created tables and one query of data from the initial scripts in the SQL database (see example in the project repository).
4. A screenshot showing an example of blob endpoints for where images are sent for storage (see example in project repository).
5. A screenshot of the redirect URIs related to Microsoft authentication (see example in the project repository).
6. A screenshot showing one potential form of logging with an "Invalid login attempt" and "admin logged in successfully", taken from the app's Log stream or other logs you create and store (see example in project repository). You can customize your log messages as you see fit for these situations.
7. Your application codeâ€”most importantly __init__.py and views.py since they will contain your updates for Auth and Logging.
8. Your WRITEUP.md file analyzing and explaining your choice between a VM or App Service.
9. OPTIONAL: A URL to your Python App Service.
